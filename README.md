# Dynamic Pricing Strategy for Uber
## Project Overview
This project aims to build a Dynamic Pricing Model for Uber, optimizing ride fares in real-time based on various factors like demand, driver availability, ride duration, and more. The current pricing model only considers ride duration, but the dynamic approach leverages additional data to ensure Uber adjusts fares in response to market conditions, improving both profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Features
Data-Driven Approach: The model is based on historical ride data and includes factors like number of riders, number of drivers, location, time of day, and customer loyalty status.
Predictive Model: A predictive model is used to suggest optimal fares for each ride in real-time.
Visualization: Insights from data are visualized to better understand patterns and trends that affect pricing.
## Dataset
The dataset includes:

* Number of riders
* Number of drivers
* Location category (urban, suburban, rural)
* Customer loyalty status (frequent riders, new riders, etc.)
* Number of past rides
* Average customer ratings
Time of booking (peak hours, off-peak hours)
* Vehicle type (economy, premium)
* Expected ride duration
* Historical cost of rides
## Key Insights
Demand and Supply: A clear relationship between demand (riders) and supply (drivers) was identified, which significantly affects optimal fare pricing.
Customer Loyalty: Frequent customers may receive adjusted fares as a reward for their loyalty, encouraging continued use of Uber's services.
Peak Times: Pricing increases during peak hours when demand outstrips supply, ensuring availability for those who need it most.
